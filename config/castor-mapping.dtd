<!--
    A collection of class mappings. This is the top level element of
    the mapping.

    All the class mappings within a collection (including all included
    collections) must be unique. A class cannot be mapped twice in the
    same collection.

    Includes another collection of mappings in this collection. Can be
    used to group several mappings from disparate files. The included
    mapping file is specified by URL.

<!--
    Describes the mapping between a Java class and an SQL table, an
    XML element, an LDAP entry, or any other engine.

    A class can be mapped to one or all of these datasources at once,
    by including all the relevant information in it's mapping.
    SQL specific information is identifier with the sql-info element,
    XML specific with the xml-info element, and so on.

    A class is specified by it's Java class name (e.g. 'myapp.Product').
    If a class extends another class for which mapping is provided,
    the extends attribute should be used. Do not use the extends
    attribute to describe Java class inheritance that is not reflected
    in any mapping.

    To map a class into an SQL table the sql-table element must be
    specified, and the identity element must be specified.

    All classes can be mapped to XML. The xml-schema element is used
    with root elements to specify the document type and namespace when
    producing XML documents from these objects.

    To map a class into LDAP an identity field must be specified.

    The class mapping specifies each field in the class that is
    mapped. Fields that are not mapped will not be stored, read, or
    otherwise processed. The order or fields is important when the
    resulting XML document must preserve the order of elements.

<!--
    Specifies the mapping between a Java field and an SQL table
    column, an XML element or attribute, an LDAP attribute, etc.

    The mapping is specified from the perspective of the Java class.
    The field name is required even if not such field exists in the
    class in order to support field references.

    Unless specified otherwise, the field is accessed through get/set
    method using the field name (thus, for a field called xyz,
    <type> getXyz() and void setXyz( <type> )). Collection fields
    require only a get method with the exception of an array that
    requires both a get and set method.

    If the accessors (get and set methods) are specified the field
    will be accessed only through these methods. The methods must be
    public and not static.

    If the attribute direct is true, the field will be accessed
    directly. The field must be public, not static and not transient.

    The field type is the proper Java class of the field's value or
    a short name that maps to a Java class (e.g. integer or
    java.lang.Integer).

    If the field is a collection, the collection type is specified with
    the collection attribute and the type of each element with the type
    attribute.

    If the field should be treated as a container (ie only it's fields
    should be persisted but not itself) the containter attribute should
    be set to true. (Currently only supported in Castor XML)

<!--
    Field mapping information relevant only for SQL.

    The SQL column name and type should be specified for all fields.
    The SQL type can be the proper Java class type returned by the
    JDBC driver or the SQL type without precision (e.g.
    java.math.BigDecimal or numeric).
    However, SQL type may contain the parameter for the SQL<->Java type
    convertors in square brackets (e.g., char[01] for false->0, true->1
    conversion from Boolean Java type to char SQL type)

<!--
    Field mapping information relevant only for XML.

    The attribute/element name and XML schema type should be specified
    for all fields. The node type indicates whether the field maps to
    an attribute, an element or the textual content of this element.
    Only simple types (primitives, date, string, etc) can be used for
    attribute values. Only one field can be specified as the content
    model in a given object.

    Note: This used to be called "xml" which is an invalid xml element name
          according to the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation. We still support
          the "xml" element for backward compatibility, but we will remove
          support for it in the future.
