<div tiddler="AlterationsToMultipleNotes" modifier="Hervé" modified="200702132219" created="200702132218" tags="Open">When assigning an alteration (sharp, flat, natural), we should look not only to simple note heads, but also to multiple note heads (such as ~BLACK_NOTE_HEAD_2), and check the geometry accordingly</div>
<div tiddler="ApplicationHanging" modifier="Hervé" modified="200707031932" created="200706081659" tags="Closed">Launching &quot;sement for stems&quot; on glyph 771 in DebuMandSample seems to hang the application\nFixed (was due to endless splitting of beam groups with erroneous beam glyphs)</div>
<div tiddler="AssignBarlines" modifier="Hervé" modified="200911092048" created="200706281944" tags="Closed">The user should have the ability to assign a barline shape (of his choice) to a glyph.\nThis is part of a larger rework to make a separation between handling barlines to retrieve systems and handling barlines to retrieve measures. The former should be part of a SYSTEMS step. Doing so, the BARS step would disappear and the barlines would be translated to measures by ScoreBuilder in some TranslateBars. The user would be able to assign and deassign measure barlines at will (within systems) just like any other symbol.\nDone in V3.2</div>
<div tiddler="AssigningSlursToParts" modifier="Hervé" modified="200702131346" created="200702012033" tags="Closed">The logic currently in use is to take the first point (left side) of the slur and consider the part of the point to be also the containing part for the slur. This works in most cases, but not in the following example where the first staff is one part, the two other staves are the second part, and the reference point of the slur is closer to staff 1 than to staff 2.\n[img[Top Slur assigned to wrong part|images/slur-part.jpg]] \nA solution would be to take into account the curvature direction of the slur, and more precisely the notes (heads ?, beams ?, stems ?) that are embraced by the slur. Then, simply use their containing part. Here these note heads belong to staff 2, and therefore to part 2.\nAnyway, we need an algorithm to determine the notes which are embraced by a given slur, so let's go this way.</div>
<div tiddler="AssignmentClarification" modifier="Hervé" modified="200707012120" created="200703121322" tags="Design Closed">Several information items are used to remember whether a Section or a Glyph is assigned (to some musical entity) or still available for further processing &amp; recognition.\n*A ''Glyph'' instance has :\n**A ''result'', which can be : \n***null\n***success\n***failure\n**A ''shape'', which can be : \n***null\n***known (not null, not //''NOISE''//)\n***wellKnown (not null, not //''~NO_LEGAL_SHAPE''//, not member of Garbage (//''NOISE''// or //''STRUCTURE''//)). This is a subset of the known glyphs.\n*A ''Section'' instance may have a link to a containing Glyph instance :\n**If the link is null, the section is free\n**If the link is not null, then the above rules apply transitively between the Glyph and the Section instances\n\nThe question is to make sure that the rules are consistently applied.\nPerhaps this dual information result / shape could be simplified. To be investigated.</div>
<div tiddler="BeamGroupPainting" modifier="Hervé" modified="200706141256" created="200702131423" tags="Closed">Use ~BeamGroup parameters to forge a common slope for beam painting. The purpose is to come out with a better looking painting of the beams than the current solution based on (rather raw) value of individual beam segments.\nVarious approaches have been tried, including forcing the slope of the longest beam in the group to be used by all beams. The results are not really better, they may even be worse on some occasions.\nSo this topic is closed.</div>
<div tiddler="BeamHookTest" modifier="Hervé" modified="200707012118" created="200707011934" tags="Closed">Add a sanity check for beam hook : the mean line must intersect the left &amp; right sides of the contour box</div>

<div tiddler="CirclesVsEllipses" modifier="Hervé" modified="200702131805" created="200702012032" tags="Design Closed">I have tried to approximate Slurs by Ellipses (see the class omr.math.Ellipse). This works but the computed ellipse if often shrunk too much, missing the slur edges by a significant number of pixels. This is reportedly due to the algebraic distance.\nEven if slurs may be closer to Ellipses that Circles, the computed Circles fit rather well. So, for the time being, I approximate Slurs by Circles, using class omr.math.Circle. </div>

<div tiddler="ModularActions" modifier="Hervé" modified="200705312117" created="200702131758" tags="Design Closed">We should start thinking about a more ''modular'' way of invoking the various processing actions.\nRather than the very sequential steps, the interactive user will need the ability to make a correction on what he can see (which means mainly from the ''Glyphs'' view), regardless of where and in which step the exact processing is located. Examples :\n*Discovering that a stem has not been isolated, because the symbol had been initially mistaken for some well known shape, preventing the stem segmenting. It's currently no use to deassign the glyph, this will not trigger the &quot;stem-segmentation&quot; of the glyph.\n*Corrections concerning Slurs should be doable from the ''Glyphs'' view, and not only run automatically in the Cleanup step.\nIn terms of modularity, we should investigate to @@work at the System level@@ :\n*Once the systems have been identified (and perhaps checked by the user), isolation should be doable most of the time.\n*Thus a modification could trigger the rebuilding of many steps ''within'' this system only\nIn terms of buffering, when several user actions are done in one shot, such as assigning the CLUTTER shape to a bunch of glyphs, we should carry out all the assignments, and only at the end call the needed rebuild.\n\nIdeas to be investigated :\n*Use of SectionGlyphRelation\n*Basic user actions\n**Stem-segment this selected glyph\n**Merge these selected glyphs\n*Define user transactions as such\n**Which should be handled as a whole. For example, all individual modifications should be performed, before further interpretation or system update is triggered.\n\nNow, most of the processing is performed System per System (even in parallel, see [[Parallelism]]).</div>

Optional syntax allows ''default to open'', ''custom button label/tooltip'' and ''automatic blockquote formatting.''\n\nYou can also 'nest' these sliders as deep as you like (see complex nesting example below), so that expandable 'tree-like' hierarchical displays can be created.  This is most useful when converting existing in-line text content to create in-line annotations, footnotes, context-sensitive help, or other subordinate information displays.\n\nFor more details, please click on a section headline below:\n++++!!!!![Configuration]&gt;\nDebugging messages for 'lazy sliders' deferred rendering:\n&lt;&lt;option chkDebugLazySliderDefer&gt;&gt; show debugging alert when deferring slider rendering\n&lt;&lt;option chkDebugLazySliderRender&gt;&gt; show debugging alert when deferred slider is actually rendered\n===\n++++!!!!![Usage]&gt;\nWhen installed, this plugin adds new wiki syntax for embedding 'slider' panels directly into tiddler content.  Use {{{+++}}} and {{{===}}} to delimit the slider content.  Additional optional syntax elements let you specify\n*default to open\n*cookiename\n*heading level\n*floater (with optional CSS width value)\n*mouse auto rollover\n*custom class/label/tooltip/accesskey\n*automatic blockquote\n*deferred rendering\nThe complete syntax, using all options, is:\n//{{{\n++++(cookiename)!!!!!^width^*{{class{[label=key|tooltip]}}}&gt;...\ncontent goes here\n===\n//}}}\nwhere:\n* {{{+++}}} (or {{{++++}}}) and {{{===}}}^^\nmarks the start and end of the slider definition, respectively.  When the extra {{{+}}} is used, the slider will be open when initially displayed.^^\n* {{{(cookiename)}}}^^\nsaves the slider opened/closed state, and restores this state whenever the slider is re-rendered.^^\n* {{{!}}} through {{{!!!!!}}}^^\ndisplays the slider label using a formatted headline (Hn) style instead of a button/link style^^\n* {{{^width^}}} (or just {{{^}}})^^\nmakes the slider 'float' on top of other content rather than shifting that content downward.  'width' must be a valid CSS value (e.g., &quot;30em&quot;, &quot;180px&quot;, &quot;50%&quot;, etc.).  If omitted, the default width is &quot;auto&quot; (i.e., fit to content)^^\n* {{{*}}}^^\nautomatically opens/closes slider on &quot;rollover&quot; as well as when clicked^^\n* {{{{{class{[label=key|tooltip]}}}}}}^^\nuses custom label/tooltip/accesskey.  {{{{{class{...}}}}}}, {{{=key}}} and {{{|tooltip}}} are optional.  'class' is any valid CSS class name, used to style the slider label text.  'key' must be a ''single letter only''.  Default labels/tootips are: &quot;&gt;&quot; (more) and &quot;&lt;&quot; (less), with no default access key assignment.^^\n* {{{&quot;&gt;&quot;}}} //(without the quotes)//^^\nautomatically adds blockquote formatting to slider content^^\n* {{{&quot;...&quot;}}} //(without the quotes)//^^\ndefers rendering of closed sliders until the first time they are opened.  //Note: deferred rendering may produce unexpected results in some cases.  Use with care.//^^\n\n//Note: to make slider definitions easier to read and recognize when editing a tiddler, newlines immediately following the {{{+++}}} 'start slider' or preceding the {{{===}}} 'end slider' sequence are automatically supressed so that excess whitespace is eliminated from the output.//\n===\n++++!!!!![Examples]&gt;\nsimple in-line slider: \n{{{\n+++\n   content\n===\n}}}\n+++\n   content\n===\n----\nuse a custom label and tooltip: \n{{{\n+++[label|tooltip]\n   content\n===\n}}}\n+++[label|tooltip]\n   content\n===\n----\ncontent automatically blockquoted: \n{{{\n+++&gt;\n   content\n===\n}}}\n+++&gt;\n   content\n===\n----\nall options combined //(default open, cookie, heading, sized floater, rollover, class, label/tooltip/key, blockquoted, deferred)//\n{{{\n++++(testcookie)!!!^30em^*{{big{[label=Z|click or press Alt-Z to open]}}}&gt;...\n   content\n===\n}}}\n++++(testcookie)!!!^30em^*{{big{[label=Z|click or press Alt-Z to open]}}}&gt;...\n   content\n===\n----\ncomplex nesting example:\n{{{\n+++^[get info...=I|click for information or press Alt-I]\n   put some general information here, plus a floating slider with more specific info:\n   +++^10em^[view details...|click for details]\n      put some detail here, which could include a rollover with a +++^25em^*[glossary definition]explaining technical terms===\n   ===\n===\n}}}\n+++^[get info...=I|click for information or press Alt-I]\n   put some general information here, plus a floating slider with more specific info:\n   +++^10em^[view details...|click for details]\n      put some detail here, which could include a rollover with a +++^25em^*[glossary definition]explaining technical terms===\n   ===\n===\n===\n!!!!!Installation\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nimport (or copy/paste) the following tiddlers into your document:\n''NestedSlidersPlugin'' (tagged with &lt;&lt;tag systemConfig&gt;&gt;)\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n!!!!!Revision History\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n''2006.07.28 - 2.0.0'' added custom class syntax around label/tip/key syntax: {{{{{classname{[label=key|tip]}}}}}}\n''2006.07.25 - 1.9.3'' when parsing slider, save default open/closed state in button element, then in onClickNestedSlider(), if slider state matches saved default, instead of saving cookie, delete it.  Significantly reduces the 'cookie overhead' when default slider states are used.\n''2006.06.29 - 1.9.2'' in onClickNestedSlider(), when setting focus to first control, skip over type=&quot;hidden&quot;\n''2006.06.22 - 1.9.1'' added panel.defaultPanelWidth to save requested panel width, even after resizing has changed the style value\n''2006.05.11 - 1.9.0'' added optional '^width^' syntax for floating sliders and '=key' syntax for setting an access key on a slider label\n''2006.05.09 - 1.8.0'' in onClickNestedSlider(), when showing panel, set focus to first child input/textarea/select element\n''2006.04.24 - 1.7.8'' in adjustSliderPos(), if floating panel is contained inside another floating panel, subtract offset of containing panel to find correct position\n''2006.02.16 - 1.7.7'' corrected deferred rendering to account for use-case where show/hide state is tracked in a cookie\n''2006.02.15 - 1.7.6'' in adjustSliderPos(), ensure that floating panel is positioned completely within the browser window (i.e., does not go beyond the right edge of the browser window)\n''2006.02.04 - 1.7.5'' add 'var' to unintended global variable declarations to avoid FireFox 1.5.0.1 crash bug when assigning to globals\n''2006.01.18 - 1.7.4'' only define adjustSliderPos() function if it has not already been provided by another plugin.  This lets other plugins 'hijack' the function even when they are loaded first.\n''2006.01.16 - 1.7.3'' added adjustSliderPos(place,btn,panel,panelClass) function to permit specialized logic for placement of floating panels.  While it provides improved placement for many uses of floating panels, it exhibits a relative offset positioning error when used within *nested* floating panels.  Short-term workaround is to only adjust the position for 'top-level' floaters.\n''2006.01.16 - 1.7.2'' added button property to slider panel elements so that slider panel can tell which button it belongs to.  Also, re-activated and corrected animation handling so that nested sliders aren't clipped by hijacking Slider.prototype.stop so that &quot;overflow:hidden&quot; can be reset to &quot;overflow:visible&quot; after animation ends\n''2006.01.14 - 1.7.1'' added optional &quot;^&quot; syntax for floating panels.  Defines new CSS class, &quot;.floatingPanel&quot;, as an alternative for standard in-line &quot;.sliderPanel&quot; styles.\n''2006.01.14 - 1.7.0'' added optional &quot;*&quot; syntax for rollover handling to show/hide slider without requiring a click (Based on a suggestion by tw4efl)\n''2006.01.03 - 1.6.2'' When using optional &quot;!&quot; heading style, instead of creating a clickable &quot;Hn&quot; element, create an &quot;A&quot; element inside the &quot;Hn&quot; element.  (allows click-through in SlideShowPlugin, which captures nearly all click events, except for hyperlinks)\n''2005.12.15 - 1.6.1'' added optional &quot;...&quot; syntax to invoke deferred ('lazy') rendering for initially hidden sliders\nremoved checkbox option for 'global' application of lazy sliders\n''2005.11.25 - 1.6.0'' added optional handling for 'lazy sliders' (deferred rendering for initially hidden sliders)\n''2005.11.21 - 1.5.1'' revised regular expressions: if present, a single newline //preceding// and/or //following// a slider definition will be suppressed so start/end syntax can be place on separate lines in the tiddler 'source' for improved readability.  Similarly, any whitespace (newlines, tabs, spaces, etc.) trailing the 'start slider' syntax or preceding the 'end slider' syntax is also suppressed.\n''2005.11.20 - 1.5.0'' added (cookiename) syntax for optional tracking and restoring of slider open/close state\n''2005.11.11 - 1.4.0'' added !!!!! syntax to render slider label as a header (Hn) style instead of a button/link style\n''2005.11.07 - 1.3.0'' removed alternative syntax {{{(((}}} and {{{)))}}} (so they can be used by other\nformatting extensions) and simplified/improved regular expressions to trim multiple excess newlines\n''2005.11.05 - 1.2.1'' changed name to NestedSlidersPlugin\nmore documentation\n''2005.11.04 - 1.2.0'' added alternative character-mode syntax {{{(((}}} and {{{)))}}}\ntweaked &quot;eat newlines&quot; logic for line-mode {{{+++}}} and {{{===}}} syntax\n''2005.11.03 - 1.1.1'' fixed toggling of default tooltips (&quot;more...&quot; and &quot;less...&quot;) when a non-default button label is used\ncode cleanup, added documentation\n''2005.11.03 - 1.1.0'' changed delimiter syntax from {{{(((}}} and {{{)))}}} to {{{+++}}} and {{{===}}}\nchanged name to EasySlidersPlugin\n''2005.11.03 - 1.0.0'' initial public release\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n!!!!!Credits\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\nThis feature was implemented by EricShulman from [[ELS Design Studios|http:/www.elsdesign.com]] with initial research and suggestions from RodneyGomes, GeoffSlocock, and PaulPetterson.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;\n!!!!!Code\n***/\n//{{{\nversion.extensions.nestedSliders = {major: 2, minor: 0, revision: 0, date: new Date(2006,7,28)};\n//}}}\n\n//{{{\n// options for deferred rendering of sliders that are not initially displayed\nif (config.options.chkDebugLazySliderDefer==undefined) config.options.chkDebugLazySliderDefer=false;\nif (config.options.chkDebugLazySliderRender==undefined) config.options.chkDebugLazySliderRender=false;\n\n// default styles for 'floating' class\nsetStylesheet(&quot;.floatingPanel { position:absolute;

<div tiddler="SectionMap" modifier="Hervé" modified="200705312121" created="200702191428" tags="Design Closed">The disruptive idea is to ''separate'' and handle the mapping data from the sections themselves. The same idea could lead to :\n*A Map&lt;Section,Glyph&gt; and a Map&lt;Section,Stick&gt; or a Map&lt;Section,Stem&gt;.\n*In fact the &quot;stick sections&quot; could be defined once and for all within each connected glyph, and either used or not. They could be used to actually separate stems and leaves, when the stick is checked as a stem, or simply to help the recognition of such symbols as Sharps, Naturals, etc... When retrieving Leaves rather than Glyphs, it suffices to take into account the Map&lt;Section,Stem&gt; to detect which sections should be used to build up the leaves and which should be left over as being assigned to a stem.\n*Keeping this information in separate maps, rather than written directly within the section, should lead to a cleaner situation. The Section does not have to be aware of the potential usages of all maps around. It's easier to erase, easier to keep several maps around, according to the purpose at hand. We also have the ability to copy part or whole of a map into a larger map.\n*Such &quot;parallel&quot; maps could be handled on a per system basis, to improve performance.\n*Perhaps this could help reduce the number of ~LagViews the user has to play with. To be investigated.\n\nHow to handle the evolution ? (Limit big bang as much as possible)\n#(done) Begin with the ~StickRelation in the current architecture\n#(partly) Then implement the Section -&gt; Glyph relationship via a map\n#(done) Make a ~GlyphLag host a default map\n#Consider several maps per System\n#Implement the glyph uniqueness (no aliases for the same physical glyph)\n#Finally, move to a more tiny use of these mappings\n\nFor tomorrow :\n*General use of SectionPredicate\n*Use of SticksBuilder (VerticalArea, etc) to be cleaned up\n*Clean use of glyphMap and relationMap\n\nEvolution : Foster a single view, with the ability for the user to play with the glyph at hand.\n*Today, we have a sequence of steps that are applied to all glyphs (almost one view par step). It's diffcult to go back (example of a non-detected stem)\n*Tomorrow, we should be able to work in the context of one glyph (the one which is selected by the user for example) and make a whole sequence of micro-steps on this glyph and its constituents. Perhaps, using some &quot;what if&quot; display, and ask the user to validate the result ?\n\nMaps : Besides the relationMaps which are relevant only during the building of sticks, we could take advantage from the availability of several maps :\n*symbolMap : section -&gt; symbol glyph\n*stemMap : section -&gt; stem stick\n*leafMap : section -&gt; leaf glyph\n*compoundMap : section -&gt; compound glyph\nQuestion : where should we find all the maps ?\n*perhaps a global glyphMap (to record the official current assignments)\n*perhaps a glyph could point to its (sub) maps ?\n\nFinally we keep the link from Section to Glyph, rather than a separate Map</div>

<div tiddler="SpuriousGlyphs" modifier="Hervé" modified="200702131357" created="200702011221" tags="">! Glyph Shape\n* Some glyphs are assigned a shape during preliminary stages using procedural logic based on structure data. This strategy applies for :\n** Ledgers (via horizontal sticks)\n** Barlines (via vertical sticks)\n* The wide majority of glyphs are recognized thanks to the Neural Network module. This accounts for all glyphs with specific shape. In fact, the output of Neural Network is not immediately made public, it has to go through a small stage that perform additional checks depending on the detected shape.\n** This is the case for Time signature, for which the pitch position is checked to lie precisely between the score lines.\n* Even later, additional checks may be performed, using generally more contextual information\n** SpuriousSlurs are a good example of additional checks, with related additional segmentation/aggregation possibilities\n** SpuriousBeams can also be detected.\n* Finally, all remaining spurious glyphs should be collected and presented as a kind of BrowsableSpuriousCollection to the user, who would have thus the ability to take proper actions.</div>
<div tiddler="SpuriousSlurs" modifier="Hervé" modified="200702131612" created="200702012033" tags="Closed">For Slurs with poor distance, two actions can be thought of (to be validated via the computed curve distance) :\n* ''Small slurs'' may be //combined// with nearby glyphs, typically other Slur, or Clutter. Today a tentative compound is valid if and only if the resulting compound doubt value is smaller than the doubt on the initial glyph. We could go beyond this, and (for Slurs only of course) use the curve distance as the proper validation check. Here are two similar examples :\n**Before merging: [img[Two slur portions|images/slur-short.jpg]]      and after merging the 2 glyphs :     [img[Slur compound once recognized|images/slur-short-compound.jpg]]\n**Before merging: [img[Before merging|images/slur-short-2.jpg]]      and after merging the 2 glyphs :     [img[After merging|images/slur-short-compound-2.jpg]]\n\n* ''Large slurs'' may be //segmented// and rebuilt incrementally section after section, while checking the curve distance. The sections left over could then be recombined (using usual connectivity) to form separate glyphs, to be later recognized.\n**Here is on the first picture an example of a long slur with a stuck object (a natural sign). Notice the circle which does not really fit the slur. \n**And the corresponding Section details on the second picture. Obviously, combining the right sections for the slur should be rather easy :\nGlyphs : [img[Glyph view of a long slur|images/slur-long.jpg]]     Sections :  [img[Section view of the same long slur|images/slur-long-sections.jpg]]\n\nHere is how this example of large slur is now fixed (notice that besides the correct Slur, the Natural sign has been correctly rebuilt and recognized):\n[img[Glyph view of the fixed slur|images/slur-long-fixed.jpg]]</div>
