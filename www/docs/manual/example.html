            The purpose of this document is to describe a very simple, yet
            realistic, use of Audiveris, so that you can get acquainted with
            some of its major features.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Nota</b>: Your own experience on the same music sheet may vary
            because some parameters may have evolved, for example you may be
            using a different Neural Network definition file and therefore the
            glyph recognition may produce different results.

            Audiveris distribution archive.
            </li>
            <li>Then the easiest way is to double-click on the jar file named

            subfolder.
            </li>

            <li>You can also use the following command:

        <p>
            This loads the image out of the selected file, and the application
            window now looks like the following. Note that the image width
            (2450 pixels) and height (1954 pixels) are listed in the log panel

            You may have noticed that the image contains a few words in French.
            Unless you have set French as the default language, Audiveris will
            assume that the dominant language in the image is English. So let's
            select the French language for this score, through the <b>Score</b>
            menu and its <b>Set Parameters</b> item.

        <p>
            This opens a small dialog box about relevant score parameters. In
            the <b>Text</b> section, select the "<b>fra - French</b>"
            alternative. Notice also that you have the ability to make this
            selection as the default for any score from now on, simply by
            putting a mark in the checkbox.<br />
            You can skip the other parameters for the time being.

            Notice that the content of the Sheet view (the lower part of the

            need to get familiar with).
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>This window contains a list of the errors that the program has
            detected in the score. The list is sorted, and every error message
            begins with a context indication.
            </li>
            <li>For example, the first line says: <i>S1P1M7 [Glyph#318]

                    <li>The location of the first message is here coded as

                    </li>
                    <li>There is also a glyph reference: [Glyph#318]

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>For any error listed in this error pane, simply clicking on a
            message will move the current focus to where the program thinks the

            sheet display are kept in sync.

        <h3>
            <a name="WRONG-SYMBOLS" id="WRONG-SYMBOLS">Wrong symbols</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first error message (Expected 3 chords for TUPLET_THREE) points
            to glyph #318, a character "3". The error stems from the fact that
            Audiveris has mistaken this character with a tuplet "3", and could
            not find the related three chords for this tuplet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../images/chula-tuplet-3.png" alt="Error on tuplet three"
            title="Source for tuplet error" />

        </p>
        <p>
            The correction is rather easy. We can simply deassign the symbol
            and let the program try to find another shape. The de-assignment
            can be triggered by pressing the <b>Deassign</b> button in the
            glyph board on the right side of the application window.
        </p>
        <p>
            This error message disappears from the error pane.
        </p>
        <p>

            You can notice that the program was unable to find another suitable
            shape for this symbol, since it is now displayed in red color.
            Notice also that the shape TUPLET_THREE is still listed at the top
            of the Neural Network suggestions, but the related button has a
            background colored in red, to indicate that this TUPLET_THREE shape
            is now "blacklisted" for this particular glyph. The program will
            never reassign this shape to the glyph, unless of course the user
            manually performs this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually this "3" is part of "31", likely to be a page number,
            which has nothing to do with our sheet of music. Since the "1" is
            assigned the CLUTTER shape, let's do the same for the "3". This
            shape is not directly suggested in the top 5 of Neural Network, so
            we have to select the glyph, and with a right-click open a context
            popup menu, select "Assign glyph as ...", then select "Physicals"
            shapes and finally "CLUTTER".
        </p>

            "Assigning CLUTTER shape" title=
            "Assigning the clutter shape to this glyph" />
        </p>
        <p>
            [Note that we could have skipped the "Deassign" action and directly
            "Assign" the final shape to this glyph. But this was a way to show
            an example of deassignment]
        </p>

        <h3>
            <a name="UNKNOWN-SYMBOLS" id="UNKNOWN-SYMBOLS">Unknown symbols</a>

        <p>
            The next message says <i>"S1P1M7 [] Voice #1 too long for Q/4"</i>
        </p>
        <p>

            This basically means that in the related measure, the total
            duration of the notes and rests that compose voice #1 is longer
            than the theoretical duration of the measure, and the delta
            represents the fourth of a quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time there is no direct indication of a "guilty" glyph.
            Clicking on this message moves us to the middle of measure 7 (of
            part 1 in system 1).

        <p>
            We can see that there is a beam hook left unrecognized (since
            colored in red) in this measure.
        </p>

        <p>
            When selecting this glyph, the beam hook does not appear in the top
            5 suggestions. We could manually assign the shape, using a
            right-click, "Assign glyph as..." and walk through the hierarchy of
            shapes as we did previously.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we have another way, since there are other beam hooks in sight:
            we can make a "copy/paste" of the shape name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select another beam hook (left click), and in the popup menu (right
            click), select the "Copy BEAM_HOOK" item.

        </p>
        <p>
            The situation is similar to the previous error. Selecting this
            error moves us to the middle of measure 13 (of part 1 of system 2)

        <p>
            When we select the red glyph (a sixteenth rest), this time the
            SIXTEENTH_REST appears in the top 5. One click on the proper
            button, and the related shape is immediately assigned to the glyph
            at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have noted that in this top 5, the sixteen_rest shape was
            listed with a red foreground color, to indicate that the confidence
            was too low. Actually the program uses the inverse of confidence,
            let's say a doubt, whose value (1.295) is above an acceptance
            threshold. You can also notice how fast the doubt value increases
            even within the top 5 suggestions, which is typical of the behavior
            of a neural network.

            You can notice that, even though these glyphs have not been
            recognized, the score display contains the right 2/4 signature.
            This is due to a rather aggressive strategy related to time
            signatures, whereby a well-recognized timesig is "forwarded" to the
            other timesig locations. This is the reason why no error was
            signaled.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the sake of completeness (and also to show you a merge example
            ...), we'll however correct this glyph, by merging the two parts.
            To do this, either select the two glyphs one after the other (using
            the CTRL key when adding the second one), or use a "lasso" by
            dragging the mouse while pressing a SHIFT key (see following
            picture).

        </p>
        <p>
            In both cases, a TIME_TWO_FOUR button should appear in the top 5.
            Simply press the button, and the proper compound glyph will be
            assigned this 2/4 shape.

        </h3>
        <p>
            There is another red glyph around the lower right corner of the
            sheet. This glyph is composed of two symbols (a flag and an eighth
            rest) stucked together. Pixels that are horizontally or vertically
            connected define a glyph. Here, we need a way to split this large
            glyph into two parts.

            A new feature of Audiveris is the ability to manually compose a
            glyph by selecting its desired sections, in the containing LAG.
        </p>
        <p>
            A short side note about LAG ((Line Adjacency Graph):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A sequence of foreground pixels defines a "Run".
            </li>
            <li>Adjacent and compatible Runs define a "Section".
            </li>
            <li>And Sections are assembled into Glyphs.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            Normally, user selections are performed at <b>glyph</b> level. We
            can switch to selection at <b>section</b> level, in the
            <b>Views</b> menu, using the "<b>Enable section selection</b>"
            item. Only vertical sections can be selected for the time being. A
            more direct way is to use the toggle button, in the toolbar, which
            represents a bean.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../images/chula-bean.png" alt="Section toggle button"
            title="Button to switch section / glyph" />
        </p>
        <p>
            In section-based selection mode (see next picture), note that all
            the section boundaries are made visible. Using the left mouse
            button, while pressing down the CTRL key, allows the user to select
            as many sections as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../images/chula-sections.png" alt="Sections" title=
            "Section boundaries" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Since sections are usually small, the selection gesture is a bit
            simplified: You don't even have to release the mouse button when
            moving from one section to the other, simply browse the sections as
            you would do with an eraser, and all the touched sections will be
            added to the selection in a "greedy" mode. To really remove a given
            section from the current selection, release the mouse button and
            press down the button again on the section to remove (always
            keeping the CTRL key down).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note, as you select the sections of the "eighth rest" portion of
            the glyph, that the Neural Network continuously tries to recognize
            a shape out of the selected sections. When you have selected all
            the sections that compose the eighth rest, the EIGHTH_REST button
            should appear in the top 5. Simply click on the related button, and
            the shape is assigned to a new glyph composed of the selected
            sections. [You can also, when your section selection is ready, use
            a right click to open the context popup menu and use the "Assign
            glyph as ..." item.]
        </p>
        <p>
            Immediately, the remaining part of the former "big" glyph is
            recognized as a flag.

        </p>
        <p>
            The word "propose" (glyph #714) has been OCR'ed as something like
            "pI'Op0 SC", even though we had selected the right language for the
            score. We are left with manually forcing the text content:
        </p>
        <ol>

            <li>Select the glyph with a left-button click in the Sheet display.
            </li>
            <li>The column on the right side of the application window is
            dedicated to a series of boards arranged in a vertical sequence
            (Pixel, Run, Section, Glyph, Focus, Neural). Use the Glyph board to
            enter the proper content for this glyph (validate by pressing
            Enter) and select Direction as the role for this piece of text.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Remark: A text glyph, even with proper content, needs to be
            assigned a "role (direction, title, creator, etc) to be atranslated
            to a score entity. Otherwise, it will appear in the score display,
            but with a gray color, and will mot be exported into the XML
            output.

            Also, on the upper right side of the sheet, the notation "Danse
            brésilienne" (glyph #720) has been OCR'ed as "Dzmse
            brésilienne". Once again, just correct the text content in

            In order to write down the score using MusicXML format, or to play
            or write Midi information, the score needs some global information
            to be assigned beforehand. The user is prompted for these
            parameters through the following dialog window:
        </p>
        <p>

            language at this point in time is still possible, all the textual
            glyphs whose language was different from the newly selected
            language will get re-OCR'ed, unless of course they had been
            manually assigned a content by the user.
            </li>

            <li>Midi data, to specify the tempo in quarters per minute, then
            the volume in the range 0..127
            </li>
            <li>A series of data, part by part, where you can read and/or
            assign part parameters: the part Id (non editable), a part name and
            a Midi instrument.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, the ability to define precisely a range of measure to
            be played. If no selection is defined, the whole score will be
            played by default.
            </li>

        <p>
            There is now a simple MusicXML/Midi interface, a Java open source
            program named XenoPlay (see the <a href=
            "http://www.xenoage.com/player/">XenoPlay website</a>), embedded
            within Audiveris. It allows a simple playback of the score through
            the platform Midi engine, as well as the writing of Midi files.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Midi features are available in the <b>Midi</b> menu, and some
            of them are directly callable from the tool bar:<br />

            <img title="Icons for Play/Pause &amp; Stop" alt="" src=
            "../images/chula-midi-play.png" />

        <p>
            There are three icons, the left one for starting/restarting the
            playback, the middle one for pausing and the right one for
            stopping.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the playback, the Score display is kept in sync, using a
            moving (violet) vertical bar on the current time slot:<br />
            <img alt="" title="Time slot highlighted while playing" src=
            "../images/chula-midi-playing.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            You can play the whole score or just a specific measure range of
            the score. The selected range can be defined through the score
            parameters dialog.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also point in the Score display with a right-click on a
            specific measure and in the popup menu, select the "Play measure"
            item as shown in the picture below. This is a contextual menu which
            shows the selected measure, information about the selected slot in
            the measure, and possibly the selected chord(s) and voice(s) in the
            slot.
