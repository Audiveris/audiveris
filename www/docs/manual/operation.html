                First, move to the directory where you've extracted the Audiveris archive. Audiveris can be launched by
                different means:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A double click on the jar file <u>audiveris-3.0.jar</u> located in the <u>dist</u> folder of the
                installation directory.
                </li>
                <li>Using the command line:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For a simple launch:
                            <div class="info">
                                $&gt; java -jar dist/audiveris-3.0.jar

                        <li>For a launch with additional JVM parameters (this example provides additional memory to the
                            application):
                            <div class="info">

                                Most of the time, there is no need for command-line arguments. They are useful when a batch
                                mode (i.e. with no user interface) is required, or to set some parameters beforehand.

                        <li>Using the .bat file located in the <u>dist</u> folder. You can add parameters to the file, so
                        this is a convenient way to register these parameters
                </li>
                <li>Using the <i>ant</i> utility from the <u>src</u> folder, and running the <b>run</b> target.
                </li>

                <li>Using NetBeans IDE. For this, after creating a NetBeans project in the installation directory,
                    you'll have first to rename the <u>build-for-netbeans.xml</u> file as <u>build.xml</u> and then ask
                NetBeans to launch the application.

                The purpose of this section is to identify and quickly present the various operations that an end user may
                perform with Audiveris. Additional details will be provided in the other sections of this document.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                Get the scan of a sheet of music
                </dt>

                <dd>
                    <div class="warningmessage">
                        Note that for the time being there is no direct link to any scanning device. So if you don't have
                        image files available, you'll have to operate the scanner beforehand by yourself and store the
                        scanned image into a file that you'll read from Audiveris.
                    </div>Whatever the origin of the scan, please pay attention to:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>
                        The scan resolution
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The best fit is around 300 DPI. Less than that results in glyphs hard to recognize. More than
                            that results in huge waste of CPU.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>
                        The image format
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            All the major formats can be used: GIF, PNG, BMP, etc. The only limits are imposed by the
                            underlying JAI library (more details available on: XXX)
                        </dd>
                        <dd>
                            Try to get gray or black &amp; white images, where a pixel is stored on 1 byte. This is by far
                            the most efficient configuration.
                        </dd>

                Translate a sheet of music
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    The most common operation is to load a sheet image, let Audiveris run through the SCORE step, manually
                    make some adjustments if needed, and then write the resulting score material into a file using MusicXML
                    format.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The automatic processing is organized in a sequence of <a href="#STEPS_SECTION">steps</a> which are
                    detailed below. Every step, with the exception of <a href="#SCALE">SCALE</a>, has a related sheet view
                    which provides visual feedback on what is being done. The user can modify the <a href=
                                                                                                     "#OPTIONS">parameters</a> values used for a specific processing. The user can also directly modify the
                    shape assigned to one or several glyphs, by selecting these glyphs and use menu items or buttons to
                    modify the assignment.
                </dd>

                <dt>
                Run a script
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A script defines a sequence of actions to be performed on a sheet. It is typically recorded as you
                    manually interact with a sheet, and can be saved on disk.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    At any time you can load a script file and it will run to its end. You can then go on and any action
                    you'll perform on the sheet will be recorded as an additional task at the end of the script.
                </dd>
                <dd>

                    <a href="#SCRIPTS">Scripts</a> can be run in batch mode as well as in interactive (non-batch) mode.

                Train the evaluator
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    At the heart of Audiveris, a neural network is in charge of finding the best shape(s) to fit a given
                    glyph.
                </dd>
                <dd>

                    Such a neural network needs to be properly trained, and the Audiveris distribution provides an
                    already-trained version of it. However, the training is very dependent upon the diversity and the
                    coverage of the training set. By manually assigning shapes, you can feed the trainer with additional
                    data, and come up with a more performant evaluator.

                <dd>
                    Audiveris provides many ways to inspect intermediate results, through specific graphic charts,
                    dedicated sheet views, context-dependent tables, etc.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    There is no hard-coded constant in Audiveris code. All values are defined as "<i>logical constants</i>"
                    and backed up on disk. A general purpose interface is available in interactive mode to browse these
                    constants and modify them if so desired. Any new value is then made available for the current and the
                    next runs of Audiveris.

                Here is a quick presentation of the main user interface. This main windows is organized as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The top pane is dedicated to the <b><i><u>Score View</u></i></b> of one sheet. We can have several
                    sheets opened, in that case there will be several sheets tabs. The score view is organized horizontally,
                    all systems are presented one besides the other.
                </li>
                <li>In the center, there are several <b><i><u>Sheet Views</u></i></b>, roughly one per step. All the sheet
                    views present the same organization of a sheet of music where the various systems are located one above the
                    other. The Picture view is the original image (perhaps deskewed), while the other ones display synthetic
                    objects.
                </li>
                <li>The bottom left pane is the <b><i><u>Log Pane</u></i></b> where all messages are logged.
                </li>

                <li>The bottom middle pane is the <b><i><u>Errors Pane</u></i></b> where the set of translation errors are
                    displayed.
                </li>
                <li>The right pane of the window is used by the <b><i><u>Boards Pane</u></i></b> which is a vertical
                    assembly of boards. The Boards Pane contant depends on the selected Sheet View. Here are the various types
                    of Boards available:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pixel:</b> Displays the current position (point or rectangle) in pixels in the sheet space.
                            The 'Level' field is filled only in the Picture sheet view, it gives the level of gray for the
                            selected pixel. Note that apart Level, all the other fields are also input fields. Just modify
                            their values and press return to modify the selected location.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Run:</b> Displays the current lag Run if any
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Section:</b> Display the current lag Section if any, with parameters related to the section
                            itself. The Id field is both output and input, so a Section can be directly selected via its
                            ID. The 3 last fields (layer, dir and role) describe the relation between this section and a
                            Stick if any
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Glyph:</b> Displays parameters of the selected Glyph if any. The 'Id' field allows to browse
                            all glyphs, while the 'Known' field handles only the glyphs with an assigned shape, and the
                            'Symb' field the glyphs that are symbols. A glyph is collection of sections, and it is never
                            deleted. A glyph is said 'Active' if its sections point back to it, so the selection of one of
                            its sections will select that glyph. The current glyph shape is displayed, both the graphic and
                            the name of the shape, and a button allows to deassign the shape at once.

            <p>

                Besides the predefined steps which operate on the whole set of sections and glyphs, any manual interaction
                can only be performed on selected glyphs. So this section first describes how to set one or several glyphs,
                then goes through the possible actions.
            </p>

                Selection
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    An entity can be selected:
                    <ul>
                        <li>By <b>typing</b> its ID (section ID, glyph ID) in the proper board. The ID of a section, or the
                            ID of a glyph never changes, whatever the actions performed on the sheet. This is the reason why
                            many log or error messages use the glyph ID.
                        </li>

                        <li>By <b>pointing</b> to it with the mouse in the sheet view (or in the score view). A left click
                            selects a section (if there is one at this location) which in turn selects a glyph if this section
                            is assigned to a glyph. Other glyphs can be added to the selection, by pressing the Control key
                            while pointing to another glyph in the sheet view.
                        </li>
                        <li>By using a <b>lasso</b>, a rectangle displayed by dragging the mouse (left button) in the sheet
                            view while a Shift key is pressed. To be selected, the glyphs must be fully enclosed by the
                            rectangle
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <dd>

                    The current location is indicated by the crossing of vertical and horizontal brown lines. Note that the
                    score view and the sheet view are synchronized regarding the location selection.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The coordinates of the selection are displayed in the Pixel board for the sheet view, while coordinates
                    expressed as a SystemPoint are displayed just under the score view.

                <dd>
                    According to the current selection, the various boards have their content updated dynamically. In
                    particular, the Neural board runs on the current selection and displays the best evaluations. Note that
                    if several glyphs are selected, the evaluation is computed against a compound dynamically built from
                    all the selected glyphs.

                    On the selected entity (or entities), several manual actions are possible:

                        <dd>
                            A shape is assigned to the selected entities. This manually assigned shape will never be called
                            into question by the program. Only another manual operation can change this assignment.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            A null shape is assigned to the selected entities. Each of the previously assigned entities
                            registers its former shape in a personal blacklist. Doing so, the shape that has been manually
                            deassigned won't be reassigned by the program. Only a manual operation can change this.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            The selected glyphs (more precisely the sections they are composed of) are assembled into one
                            new compound glyph. If the new glyph is found to have the same signature than an existing
                            glyph, they are considered as being the same entity.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            The selected glyphs are looked up for the presence of verticals (such as potential stems, or
                            shorter vertical segments). The remaining sections are then assembled into leaf glyphs.

                <dd>
                    Score entities, as they appear in the score view and are exported to MusicXML, are "translated" from
                    assigned glyphs by the ScoreBuilder class.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    There is no "direct injection" of any score entity to the score structure. This is consistent with the
                    rationale that Audiveris is a music scanner, not a score editor. Manually injecting score entities is
                    typically an editor feature, and should be addressed by connecting an external score editor to
                    Audiveris MusicXML output.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Unless such editor can be tightly integrated with Audiveris, this unability to inject score entities
                    may be felt as a limitation, perhaps to be addressed in a future Audiveris release.

                Its understanding is straightforward: the tag name defines an action (step, assign, segment, deassign,
                export) associated with its proper parameters. You can manually edit the script, but note that the glyphs
                are designated via their ID, a simplistic solution to be secured in a future release of Audiveris.

                To present the various operations, and the related user interface, we'll use a tour based on the usual
                sequence of processing steps, since nearly every step has a related view

            <p>
                In this example, we have a black and white image, so the grey level of the current pixel is either 0 (black
                foreground) or 255 (white background). The mouse is currently on a pixel of the C Clef, so the "Pixel"
                board of the data panel reports a 0 level value for abscissa 235 and ordinate 459.
            </p>
            <p>
                By dragging the mouse, while keeping the shift key pressed, we can define a rectangle. The x and y values
                are the coordinates of the upper left corner, and the width and height are the dimensions of the defined
                rectangular area.

                <a name="SCALE" id="SCALE">Scale Step</a>

            </h3>
            <p>
                This step aims at computing the general "scale" of the music sheet, which is basically the average vertical
                distance between two staff lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do so, we use a very simple algorithm, based on vertical runs of foreground (black) pixels and vertical
                runs of background (white) pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The black histogram gives the average line thickness, and the white histogram the white interval between
                two staff lines. The interline value is thus defined as the sum of these two values.
            </p>

            <p>
                This step has no related sheet view. But, using the menu <i><u>File</u> &gt; <u>Scale Plot</u></i>, we get
                a separate chart as displayed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The red histogram describes the lengths of the black runs, with a sharp peak on value 3 for this
                    example.
                </li>
                <li>The blue histogram displays the white runs, with also a peak on value 18 for this sheet example.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                For this sheet example, the main interline value is thus 3 + 18 = 21 pixels. And this value will drive the
                computation of nearly all parameters used in the recognition process.

            <p>

                The purpose of this step is to compute the average skew angle of the staff lines for the whole sheet. This
                of course is just an average value, since all staff lines may not be strictly parallel.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the absolute value of the computed slope exceeds a given threshold, then the image is rotated
                (<i>de-skewed</i>) is the opposite direction, so as to ease the later detection of vertical and horizontal
                sticks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can display the sheet view related to the skew computation, as in the following picture. Nota: if this
                view is not displayed, check the property <em>"omr.SkewBuilder.displayFrame"</em> using the <b>Options</b>

                tool. The <i>"common"</i> sections are colorized in colors close to green or blue, while the sections that
                compose the <i>"significant"</i> horizontal sections are colorized in red. We can notice that the staff
                lines are the main contributors to the long horizontal section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that the Data Panel exhibits two additional boards:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <i>"Run"</i> board displays information about the run designated by the mouse location. The
                    selected run here starts at abscissa 200 (we have horizontal runs in this view) and is 312 pixel long. The
                    average grey level along the run is 0, since here it is made of only foreground pixels with 0 as gray
                    level.
                </li>

                <li>The <i>"Section"</i> board displays data that pertains to the current section (a section is a set of
                    contiguous runs). A section is given an <i>"Id"</i> to ease its future handling. The fields labelled <i>
                        "X"</i>, <i>"Y"</i>, <i>"Width"</i> and <i>"Height"</i> represent the bounding rectangle of this (here
                    horizontal) section. The fields labelled <i>"Layer"</i> and <i>"Dir"</i> are actually not used for this
                    step.
                </li>

            </ol><img src="../images/skew.png" title="Sections for skew computation" alt="#########" />
            <p>
                We can also get the following chart, by using the menu <i><u>File</u> &gt; <u>Skew Plot</u></i>:
            </p><a name="SKEW_PLOT" id="SKEW_PLOT"><img src="../images/slope-chart.png" title="Histogram of main slopes"

            <p>
                This step is about staff lines, to properly detect all staff lines and "remove" them from the sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The detection is driven by the horizontal projection of foreground (black) pixels. A dedicated chart,
                displayed from menu <i><u>File</u> &gt; <u>Line Plot</u></i>, makes this more obvious as can be seen on the
                following chart. We use a threshold (at roughly half the maximum histogram value, and indicated by a
                vertical red line on the chart), and every regular series of 5 peaks above this threshold defines the 5
                stick areas supposed to contain one staff line each.

            <p>
                The processing is then performed stick area per stick area. In such area, we retrieve the long horizontal
                sticks that compose the staff line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The detected lines are then cleaned up: The underlying pixels are erased from the original picture, and a
                specific algorithm is used to extend crossing objects (objects that were overlaid upon the staff lines).
            </p>
            <p>
                The cleaned data is visible on the following view, where former staff lines have been replaced by synthetic
                lines:

            <p>

                Note that, by using <i><u>Views</u> &gt; <u>Show original staff lines</u></i>, we can switch between:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The display of the former line pixels (colorized in yellow),
                </li>
                <li>The display of synthetic lines and of extended crossing objects.
                </li>
            </ul>

                or thin bar lines). Notice in the following figure that the glyph of the bar line is properly assigned the
                shape name "THIN_BAR_LINE".
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice also that, by clicking with the mouse on the related barline glyph, a new boards gets visible in the
                boards pane, labelled "Bar check". It contains a table of all results for a suite of checks applied to the
                glyph at hand before accepting it as a barline glyph. Other tests are performed, using for example the
                location of the other barlines of the same system, but this one is focused on the characteristic of just
                the glyph at hand.
            </p>
            <p>

                The table contains one row per check:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>T/F is true/false boolean for covariance of the measured variable. Covariant means "<i>larger is
                        better</i>".
                </li>
                <li>The following number (here 1) is the relative weight of the check within the suite.
                </li>
                <li>Then the name for the value checked. "Top" measures the ordinate difference between the top of the
                    candidate barline glyph and the upper line of the staff. Values are stated in fractions of interline.
                </li>
                <li>The the measure value is displayed with green, orange or red color, depending on how this value fits
                    with respect to the defined range.
                </li>

            </ul>And the final row gives the final result, positive in this case.
            <p>
                All fields in this table have tooltip text that is displayed when simply moving the mouse over them.

                <a name="SYMBOLS" id="SYMBOLS">Symbols Step</a>
            </h3>
            <p>

                In this step, browsing through the yet unassigned sections, we aggregate connected sections into symbol
                glyphs, and try to recognize these symbols. This of course works only for symbols with a rather fixed
                appearance, such as clefs or time signatures on the following picture, it does not work for constructions
                like notes with stem, chords, etc...
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, we have correctly recognized "BRACE", "G_CLEF", "FLAT", "TIME_TWO_FOUR", "DOT" and
                "STRUCTURE".
            </p>
            <p>
                The mouse is currently on what is called a structure, recognized as such by the evaluator, which is a
                structure of to-be-segmented smaller parts (note head, stem, flag).
            </p><img src="../images/symbols.png" title="Extraction of stand-alone symbols" alt="#########" />
            <p>
                This step also focuses on non-recognized glyphs that may be the result of undesired segmentation. This
                frequently occurs because of staff line removal for symbols such as F clef or common time signature.
            </p>

            <p>
                The algorithm used is to browse through all unknown glyphs, ordered by decreasing weight, and to try to
                aggregate neighbors that are other unknown glyphs of the same system. If the result of this combination
                leads to some recognized symbol, then we keep it as a (compound) glyph. Otherwise, we don't keep the
                compound.
            </p>
            <p>
                This cares for symbols that are typically segmented by the removal of staff lines, despite the efforts made
                to keep crossing objects connected. This happens frequently for bass clefs, or for common time signatures.

                This step aims at retrieving all the vertical sticks which are either stems, or vertical parts of alternate
                endings. (Nota: just the stems are extracted for the time being).

                line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice also that pointing on a retrieved stem (or on just a candidate stem) displays a "Stem check" board
                with the detailed result of stem tests.

            <p>
                The stem extraction has led to the creation of numerous "leaves", which we now try to assign a shape to.
                The "Leaves" step thus recognized all the individual leaves of the following image (most of the time, these
                leaves are note heads, or flags, or beams).
            </p><img src="../images/leaves.png" title="Recognized leaves" alt="#########" /><br />
            <p>
                Just like symbols, leaves may have been unduely segmented. The difference between the two images below is
                the building of a compound, properly recognized as a void notehead.

            <p>
                This is a final cleaning up step, focused on glyphs unduely segmented to stems. For example, accidentals
                such as sharps, naturals or flats are symbols which actually contain one or two (small) stems. If these
                symbols are not recognized during the SYMBOLS step, then their stems are extracted and new leave glyphs are
                then tried, generally to no avail.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the time being, we simply call these stems into questions. To do so, we try to cancel any stem which
                has no connected recognized leave. Then, we build new glyphs from these now unassigned sections. If we get
                to recognized glyphs, then we keep these glyphs, otherwise we "resurrect" the stems.
            </p><br />

                proper score entity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that several such glyphs may be translated to a single score entity. This is the case for all the
                glyphs that compose a key signature: the collection of all related sharps for example are assigned to one
                key signature score entity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is a complete Score hierarchy, whose components are displayed in the Score view. Here they will
                still need some manual adjustments, before being exported to MusicXML.
            </p>
            <p>
                This closes the series of automated steps, since the adjustments are performed manually. They are described

                This interface is used to ease the setting of shape colors. It is a very basic interface, which gathers a

            <p>
                The policy is to assign a color to a shape range. A shape range for example can be all note heads, or all
                rests. And by default, all shapes within the range are assigned the color of the range, unless of course we
                assign them a specific color.

                The purpose of this "Glyph Verifier" is to provide a user interface to review visually some or all of the
                various glyphs which are used for training the evaluator.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main objective is thus to easily identify glyphs which have been assigned a wrong shape. Using them as
                part of the training base could make serious damage in the performance of the evaluator. So the strategy,
                when such a wrong glyph has been identified, is simply to delete the glyph from the base.
            </p>
            <p>

                The top panels are dedicated to selectors, in that order:
            </p>
            <ol>

                <li>The <b>Sheet</b> selector. It allows to select one or several sheets from the base at hand (which by
                    default is the global <i><u>/train/sheets</u></i> directory
                </li>
                <li>The <b>Shape</b> selector. Only the shapes that are contained in the selected sheets in the Sheet
                    selector are displayed here. And you can select some or all shapes form the displayed list.
                </li>
                <li>The <b>Glyph</b> selector. Similarly, only glyphs whose shape is selected in selected sheets are
                    displayed in the list. You can manually select the glyph instances you want to review.
                </li>

            </ol>
            <p>
                The large panel, on the lower right side, is dedicated to the display of the selected glyphs, using their
                own coordinates. Notice that glyphs that belong to separate sheets, can thus happen to have similar
                coordinates and thus be displayed as overlapping glyphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lower left panel is composed of two main parts:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <b>Navigator</b> to drive the loading and display of glyphs from the selection as it comes out of
                    the selectors. You can navigate through the loaded glyphs.
                </li>

                <li>The <b>Glyph</b> panel, similar to the one that appear on the main Audiveris windows, is used to
                    display information about the glyph at hand, together with the evaluations performed by the Neural Network
                    evaluator. The "Deassign" button can be used to discard a wrong glyph: this is implemented through the mere
                    deletion of the underlying glyph XML file.

                By default, this user interface looks for glyphs files under the <i><u>/train/sheets</u></i> directory.
                However, from the <b>Trainers</b> interface, you can ask to <b>Verify</b> glyphs (see that interface). In
                that latter case, the <b>Training Material</b> interface is automatically loaded with the corresponding
                glyphs, which may be part of either the whole glyph base (the default), or just the core glyph base.

        <li>We are in the package named <i>"sheet"</i>, (actually, its full name is <i>"omr.sheet"</i>, but we drop
            the ubiquitous <i>"omr."</i> prefix) and the class named <i>"LinesBuilder"</i>, in charge of retrieving and
            removing the staff lines.
        </li>

        <li>This class has a logging level, currently assigned to <i>"INFO"</i>. This information comes from the
        <u>config/logging.properties</u> file, but can be modified on the fly, thanks to this interface, to any
        legal logging value (such as DEBUG, INFO, etc...). <b>NOTA</b>: these logging level modifications are meant
        to be temporary, and thus not stored on disk. For persistent modification, please edit the logging property
        file directly.
        </li>
        <li>The class also contains several logical constants, which are application-level parameters, whose
            precise value is kept separate from the algorithmic code. For example, the second constant, named
            <i>histoThresholdFrac</i>, is a java variable declared in the <i>LinesBuilder</i> class. It is a
            Constant.Double, whose current value is 0.5. A tip text is displayed, which says "Peak threshold stated as
            a ration of maximum histogram value". In other words, this defines the threshold that indicates a staff
            line on the histogram built with horizontal projections.
        </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
        There is a predefined list of types available for such constants (for details, please refer to the JavaDoc
        of class <a href="https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/constant/Constant.html">Constant</a>) :
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>Constant.Boolean</i>
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>Constant.Color</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Constant.Double</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Constant.Integer</i>

        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Constant.String</i>
        </li>
    </ul>All these Constant subtypes encapsulate values of their standard counterpart, in other words a
    Constant.Boolean contains a Boolean value, etc...
    <p>
        Another possible type is <i>Scale.Fraction</i> which is a double, whose unit is the interline value. For
        example, in a sheet with interline value of 20 pixels, a Fraction of 0.15 will represent 3 pixels. It's a
        way to specify a length regardless of the actual sheet interline value. In the Options window, when such a
        Fraction value is displayed, its counterpart in pixels is also displayed provided that the current sheet
        has already had its scale computed. Otherwise, just a question mark is displayed. Please refer to details
        in <a href="https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/sheet/Scale.html">Scale</a> JavaDoc.
    </p>

    <p>
        How do we define the current value of such logical constant ? The JavaDoc of class <a href=
                                                                                              "https://audiveris.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/omr/constant/ConstantManager.html">ConstantManager</a>
        explains this mechanism in details. The overriding sequence is defined as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>First the value as defined in the source code,
        </li>
        <li>Then, if the constant name is found in the file named <u>config/run.default.properties</u>, the related
        value is used.
        </li>

        <li>Finally, the user home directory may contain a file named <u>.audiveris/run.properties</u>. Is such
        file exists and contains the constant name, then its related value is taken for the constant. This last
        file is not meant to be manually edited by a user, it is automatically updated each time the user uses the
        <i><u>Options</u></i> interface to modify a constant value, thus making the modification persistent for the
        subsequent runs of the application.
        </li>
