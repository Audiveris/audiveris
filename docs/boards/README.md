# Boards

This chapter gathers the descriptions of all boards.

A board is a small UI panel, generally located in the right column of Audiveris main window
(the boards column), although it can also appear in other windows such as the sample repository
browser.

It is focused on a specific kind of OMR entity (pixel, glyph, inter, section, sample, ...) and
offers input and output features related to the OMR entity kind.

A board reads and/or writes to one or several event buses according to the OMR entity kind handled.
See [Debug menu](/menus/debug.md) for further details on event services.

Most boards can be dynamically shown or hidden via a right-click in the boards column.

Here are all the defined boards:
* [Pixel](/boards/pixel.md)
