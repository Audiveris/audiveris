# Pulldown menus

This chapter simply describes all Audiveris menus, both the pulldown menus and the popup context
menu of Audiveris main window.

Since this chapter if meant for reference, each menu is described in its full extent,
thus including advanced topics if any.
To be visible and callable, advanced topics must be explicitly selected via the
[Advanced Topics](../advanced/topics.md) dialog.
