# Outputs

Output files are generally located in the dedicated subfolder of the related book.
See the [Folders](../folders/README.md) chapter.

This chapter presents the various output formats designated by their file extension.

A special emphasis is put on the `.omr` format, since this format governs the internal
structuring of any Audiveris project file.
Such file is also named a Book file, because there is one `.omr` project file per Book, and the
file merely represents the marshalling of Book internal data from memory to disk.
