# Main concepts

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some key notions that are used throughout
the whole application and that the end-user needs to understand Audiveris correctly.

We will thus speak of:
* Physical and logical containment: Book of Sheets vs. Score of Pages,
* Pixels assemblies: Runs, Sections and Lags,
* Interpretations: Glyphs vs. Inters,
* Relations between interpretations: the Symbol Interpretation Graph (SIG).
