# Load

To load an image from disk, we can use the pull-down menu {{ site.file_input }}:

![](../../assets/images/file_input.png)

An `Open` dialog will show up, allowing us to navigate between folders and finally select an image
input file:

![](../../assets/images/open_dialog.png)

Another way to load an input file is to drag this file from the File Explorer and to drop it onto
the Audiveris application window.

Audiveris accepts a variety of image formats as input, notably PDF, TIFF, JPG, PNG, BMP.

Here, we have selected the file `chula.png`, and the application window now displays the
contained image.
Actually, it's a *binarized* version of the image:

![Binarized image](../../assets/images/chula_binarized.png)
