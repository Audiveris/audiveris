# Play

Strictly speaking, this feature is not part of Audiveris, but rather pertains to an
external program (a simple music sequencer or some high-level editor).  
Many external programs can work on Audiveris MusicXML export,
thanks to the _de facto_ standard MusicXML exchange format.

Here, we have simply imported the `chula.mxl` MusicXML file into MuseScore.

Note that this music editor displays the imported music correctly.
We just have to press the play button to listen to the music.

This is the end of our quick tour.
