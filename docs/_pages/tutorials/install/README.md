# Installation

## Using installers
{: .d-inline-block }
new in 5.5
{: .label .label-yellow }

A 64-bit installer is provided for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux**.

An installer simplifies installation but has the main disadvantage of being limited
to the latest official version, which may be several months old.

## Building from source

For **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux**,
you have the ability to **clone and build** from the source code.

The main advantage of doing this is to benefit from all the bug fixes and improvements that are
continuously published in the "development" branch of the Audiveris project.
