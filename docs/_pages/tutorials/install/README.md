# Installation

## Using installers
{: .d-inline-block }
new in 5.5
{: .label .label-yellow }

For **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux**, Audiveris provides installers available in 64-bit version.

An installer simplifies installation but has the main disadvantage of being limited
to the latest official version, which may be several months old.

## Building from sources

For **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux** and **ArchLinux**,
you have the ability to **clone and build** from the source material.

The main advantage is to benefit from all the bug fixes and improvements that are
continuously published on the Audiveris project site in its "development" branch.
