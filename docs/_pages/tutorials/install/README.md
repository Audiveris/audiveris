# Installation

## Installers

For **Windows** and for **Linux**, Audiveris provides installers available in 64-bit version.
 
An installer makes the installation simple but has the main drawback of being limited to
the last official release, which can be several months old.

## Building from sources

For the major operating systems (**Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux** and **ArchLinux**),
we have the ability to **clone and build** from the source material.

The main advantage is to benefit from all the bug fixes and improvements that are
continuously published on the Audiveris project site in its "development" branch.
