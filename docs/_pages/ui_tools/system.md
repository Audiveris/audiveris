## System Merge
{: .no_toc }

In the Audiveris ``GRID`` step, detected staves are gathered into systems, based on barlines found on
the left side of the staves.

In a poor quality score image, many black pixels may have disappeared, sometimes leading to broken
barlines.

In the example image below, the leading left barline has been damaged, resulting in a wrong
detection of systems by the OMR engine.

| Left barline broken | Resulting grid before fix | Resulting grid after fix |

Since the 5.2 release, we can manually fix this problem.

We point at the upper system portion, and via the right-click popup menu, navigate to `System#n ...`
and click on "_Merge with system below_".

This is a key operation, so we need to confirm the detailed prompt:

![](../assets/images/system_merge_prompt.png)

And it's done: a connector was created between the two barline portions and the two system
portions merged.

We can still undo/redo the operation.
