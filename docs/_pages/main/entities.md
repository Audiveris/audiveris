## Main Entities

The purpose is not to describe the full data model of Audiveris, but simply to introduce some
key notions that are used throughout the whole application and that the end-user needs to
understand correctly.

We will thus speak of:
* Physical containment: Book of Sheets,
* Logical containment: Score of Pages,
* Pixels assemblies: Runs, Sections and Lags,
* Interpretations: Glyphs vs Inters,
* Relations between Inters: the Symbol Interpretation Graph (SIG).
