# Main Features

This chapter presents the main features of the Audiveris application, especially the user GUI and the
pipeline of the OMR engine, from input to outputs.

The manual correction of OMR results is such an important topic that it deserves the separate
[UI Tools](../ui_tools/README.md) and [UI Examples](../ui_examples/README.md) chapters.

A few specific features are gathered in the [Specific Features](../specific/README.md) chapter.

And more advanced features can be found in the [Advanced Features](../advanced/README.md) chapter.
