## Output Formats

There are 3 possibilities for output of a transcribed score:

* Output as **OMR** file for saving and later reloading of OMR data for additional processing,
manual correction or production of other outputs.  
See the [.omr format](../outputs/omr.md) section.

* Output as **PDF** file for direct use by a musician.
It writes the resulting image into a PDF file, which is basically the content of the Picture/Binary
tab in logical mode.  
See the [.pdf format](../outputs/pdf.md) section.

* Output as **MusicXML** file for use in a score notation program.
It writes a MusicXML file with the exported score entities.  
See the [.mxl format](../outputs/mxl.md) section.
