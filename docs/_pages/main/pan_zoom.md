### Pan and Zoom {#pan-and-zoom}

#### Moving {#moving}

The sheet image is usually larger than the window where the sheet is displayed.
We can move the display over the sheet using different means:

* By moving the scroll bars,
* By keeping the mouse left button pressed, and moving the selection point close to a border
  of the display,
* By keeping both mouse buttons pressed, and dragging the image with the selection point,
* By pressing down the mouse wheel and dragging the image with the selection point,
* By rolling the mouse wheel to move the display up or down,
* By pressing on one of the 4 arrow keys to move the display in related direction,
* By pressing on one of the 4 arrow keys, while `Shift` is held down, to move pixel by pixel.

#### Zoom {#zoom}

It can be adjusted in the range [1:8 to 32:1] by several means:

* By using the vertical slider located on the left side of the sheet window.
* By using the mouse wheel while holding the `Ctrl` key pressed.
* On the numeric keypad:
  - Key `+` to zoom in,
  - Key `-` to zoom out,
  - Key `0` to reset zoom.
* On the keyboard:
  - Key `Ctrl+ =` (as well as `Ctrl+Shift =`) to zoom in,
  - Key `Ctrl+ -` (as well as `Ctrl+Shift -`) to zoom out,
  - Key `Ctrl+ 0` (as well as `Ctrl+Shift 0`) to reset zoom.
* By using a rectangular "lasso" while holding both keys `Ctrl+Shift` pressed.
When releasing the mouse, the zoom will be adjusted so that both rectangle sides become fully visible.
* By using the predefined buttons ![](../assets/images/zoom1.png)and ![](../assets/images/zoom2.png),
we can fit to the sheet's width or height, respectively.

When zooming in or out, the display remains focused on its current selection, if any.
