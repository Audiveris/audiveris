## Tremolo
{: .no_toc }
{: .d-inline-block }
new in 5.3
{: .label .label-yellow }

Since release 5.3, Audiveris can handle tremolos as depicted below:

![](../assets/images/tremolos.png)

A tremolo is composed of 1, 2 or 3 slanted segments.

It must be horizontally aligned with a chord, either a stem-based chord or a stem-less chord.
Both cases are shown in picture above.

{: .warning }
Audiveris does not yet address the case of tremolos located _**between**_ two chords,
as shown in the picture below, stolen from Wikipedia:  
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Tremolo_notation_two_notes.svg/324px-Tremolo_notation_two_notes.svg.png)

If the OMR engine has not recognized a tremolo, you can always assign or drag the desired
tremolo from the shape palette, using the ``BeamsEtc`` shape set.

Tremolo editing is limited to translations of the item, which will snap on compatible
chords nearby.
