a note should be played.

[Assuming a right-handed person]:
- **Fingering** describes the left-hand finger, via a digit number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Plucking** describes the right-hand finger, via a letter (``p``, ``i``, ``m``, ``a``)

### Example

Here is an example with fingering indications (in red squares)
and plucking indications (in green circles):

### Detection

The OMR engine must be explicitly told to detect these indications.
This can be done via the processing switches in ``Book | Set Book Parameters`` pulldown menu:

![](../assets/images/fingering_plucking_switches.png)

### Insertion 

Regardless of the switches values, we can always manually assign or drag & drop these
indications from the shape board:

### Export

These indications get exported to MusicXML and are thus visible from MuseScore for example:
