## Drums
{: .no_toc }
{: .d-inline-block }
new in 5.3
{: .label .label-yellow }

We owe many thanks to Brian Boe for his decisive contribution to this long-awaited functionality.

First requests for drums notation go back to 2017,
see Audiveris [issue #33](https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris/issues/33). 
This delay certainly originated in my personal ignorance (HervÃ© speaking) about this kind of notation.

### Example

This [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_notation) provides a good
introduction to drums notation.  

Since 5.3 release, Audiveris supports drums unpitched notation on both 5-line and 1-line staves,
as shown in the following excerpt:

![](../assets/images/drums_stave_sizes.png)

1. Each staff starts with a percussion clef,
2. Each individual instrument is defined by a given head motif at a given line position  
   (drum set mapping).
3. Though not specific to drums notation, we can frequently observe
[multi-measure rests](./multi_rest.md) and [measure-repeat signs](./bar_repeat.md).

### Processing switches

To be able to transcribe the example above, we have to set two specific processing book parameters,
available in dialog ``Book | Set Book Parameters``, one for 1-line
and one for 5-line percussion stave sizes:

![](../assets/images/drums_params_2sizes.png)

In batch mode, we can also set these switches at command line interface level:
> -option org.audiveris.omr.sheet.ProcessingSwitches.oneLineStaves=true

> -option org.audiveris.omr.sheet.ProcessingSwitches.drumNotation=true

### Drum set mapping

There seems to be no universal specification for drum set mapping, only some recommandations.  
This means that, depending on a score author, the mapping can be different.

Audiveris provides a default mapping via the ``drum-set.xml`` file in its ``res`` resource folder.  
Content of this XML file is listed in [appendix](#appendix).

Within the ``drum-set`` XML root element, there is one ``staff`` XML element per staff size 
(one for 1-line staves, one for 5-line staves).

The mapping definition is a list of entries within the containing ``staff`` XML element.
- It is presented by increasing line/space number, but only for ease of browsing.
- Each ``entry`` XML element contains the following XML attributes:
    - "``pitch-position``": line/space number (0 being the mid-line, values increasing top down)
    - "``motif``": general head shape (oval, small, cross, diamond, triangle, circle)
    - "``sound``": intrument name (Acoustic_Bass_Drum, etc. see appendix)
    - "``sign``": this attribute is optional, it indicates a playing technique
    (PLAYING_OPEN, PLAYING_HALF_OPEN, PLAYING_CLOSED)

This protected resource is just the *default* mapping:
- As an end-user, we can always incrementally override some or all of the default mapping entries,
by writing our own entries in a similar but certainly smaller ``drum-set.xml`` file to be located
in user ``config`` folder.
- To "nullify" an existing default entry, we simply specify a "``null``" value
for its "``sound``" attribute.

### Transcription

Among the examples used when working on drums with Brian, we can recommand the
[Redeye Percussion](https://www.redeyepercussion.com/) site.  
Its "Sheet Music" top link gives access to hundreds of percussion scores.

Here below is the example of
[Ophelia](https://www.redeyepercussion.com/music/Ophelia_TheBand_redeyepercussion.com.pdf),
a simple one-page score.

Beginning of the PDF file, downloaded from Redeye Percussion site, is as follows:

![](../assets/images/drums_ophelia.png)

Before launching the OMR engine, we specify book parameters
using the ``Book | Set Book Parameters`` dialog:

![](../assets/images/drums_ophelia_params.png)

Note the specific selections made:
- **Music font**: We do need the "JazzPerc" music font family for best efficiency on this example.
- **5-line unpitched percussion staves**: this will allow the processing of drums notation on
5-line staves
- **Small heads**: we have cue heads in this score
- **Small beams**: we have cue beams tied to the cue heads

And with no additional user action, the raw transcription gives:

![](../assets/images/drums_ophelia_result.png)

There is one abnormal measure, shown in pink.  
It is due to a flag mistaken with a black head, something easy to fix.

Should we need to manually fix other transcription errors, we would certainly end up playing
with the ``HeadsAndDot`` palette in the shape board.  
For the "``Jazz Perc``" font family and the selected processing switches, this palette provides
the following symbols:

![](../assets/images/font_ophelia_heads.png)

It is organized as follows:
- First, the heads part: 
    - One row per head **motif** (``oval`` through ``circle``)
    - One column per head increasing **duration** (1/4, 1/2 , 1, 2)
- The next row is dedicated to the augmentation dot and the pre-built quarter and half notes.
- The last row presents the playing **signs** [^playing_signs] (open, half-open, closed) that can
appear away from heads.

## Appendix

Here below is the content of ``drum-set.xml`` file provided in Audiveris ``res``
application folder.

Remember the end user can still override some default definitions
via a similar ``drum-set.xml`` file to be located in user ``config`` folder.

<!--
    This file, located in Audiveris 'res' folder, defines drum default mapping.
    The end-user can override part or whole of this mapping by writing a specific drum-set.xml file
    located in Audiveris user 'config' folder.

    Such file defines Audiveris entries for general midi percussion keys.
    Definitions are grouped by staff line count with one attribute:
    
    - line-count        (Mandatory)
                        count of lines in percussion staff
                        (1 or 5)

    Within a staff group, it is written as a list of entries for a sound map organized as:
    key:    a tuple (pitch-position, motif, [sign])
    value:  the corresponding sound value
                       
    - pitch-position:   (Mandatory)
                        head position relative to staff line/space
                        (0 for middle line, positive downwards)

    - motif:            (Mandatory)
                        motif of head shape, regardless of its duration
                        (oval, small, cross, diamond, triangle, circle)

    - sign:             (Optional, default value is null)
                        percussion playing technique
                        (PLAYING_OPEN, PLAYING_HALF_OPEN, PLAYING_CLOSED)

    - sound:            (Mandatory)
                        name of drum sound
                        The name must contain no space, no dash, just underscores.
                        A null sound value removes the entry at (pitch-position,motif,sign) tuple
                        For a comprehensive list of sound names, please refer to
