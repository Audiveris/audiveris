## Purpose

Audiveris uses these locations for persistency of internal information.

These files are **not** meant to be edited, period!

## GUI folder

These are opaque files used for GUI lifecycle (notably last position and size of each window)
- mainFrame.session.xml
- optionsFrame.session.xml
- aboutDialog.session.xml
- etc...

| --- | --- |
| **Windows** | %APPDATA%\\AudiverisLtd\\audiveris |
| **Linux** | ~/audiveris |
| **MacOS** | TODO: !!! **I DON'T KNOW** !!!|

## Log folder

Each session of Audiveris application creates in this folder a single global `dateTtime.log` file
that covers all log events of the session.

It is a temporary storage for various needs, such as saving a snapshot of a score image portion.
