## .pdf files

Audiveris can print out a whole book or a single sheet.

In both cases, it provides a `.pdf` file, located by default in the book subfolder.

The pdf file contains one page per sheet and its content is basically the logical output
of the Data tab, with no annotations and no colored voices.

If no recognition error remains, this pdf should very closely look like the original image.
