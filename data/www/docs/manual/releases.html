                        The release results from the adoption of Java Web Start
                        to provide a single and consistent way to download / 
                        install / run Audiveris.
                        <br/>
                        <i>NOTA:</i> This release should be the last one in the
                        4.x series.
                        Development of Audiveris 5.x has begun, with the main
                        objective to support even poor-quality scores.

                                underlying OS (Windows or Linux) and
                                architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), Audiveris 
                                software is now made available via a single 
                                entry point on its web site.
                                
                                This takes care of all dependencies 
                                (Java runtime, C++ runtime, binary libraries,
                                Tesseract languages, etc).

                    <div class="desc">
                        The major features of this release were made possible thanks
                        to the interfacing of new Google Tesseract C++ code (v3.x).
                        The too few members of Tesseract project had no time to 
                        provide a clean DLL interface of their new version.
                        <br/>
                        Kudos to Maxim Polijakovski for this long awaited bridge and
                        for the configuration of Audiveris on provided OSes and 
                        machine architectures.
                        <br/>
                        Many thanks also to Ryo Hang who took the initiative to
                        address non-uniform gray images and came out with the
                        prototype of an adaptive binarization filter.

                                <code>Windows</code> and <code>Linux</code> and 
                                machine architectures <code>x86</code> and

                                The installers take care of all Audiveris
                                dependencies (Java runtime, C++ runtime, musical 
                                font, etc).

                                Nota: Support for <code>MacOS</code> has been 
                                dropped from the scope of this release to avoid 
                                further delays.

                                (<code>deu</code>, <code>eng</code>,

                                <b>OCR:</b> <code>Tesseract V3.02</code> has been 
                                integrated in place of oldish V2.04 version.
                                This much more powerful engine has led to a 
                                global redesign of text handling within Audiveris. 
                                There is now a dedicated <code>TEXTS</code> step 
                                which performs a layout analysis
                                on each whole system image and transcribes the 
                                identified textual items.
                                Note also that several languages can be selected at
                                the same time.

                                from the background has long been performed using
                                a <code>global</code> threshold on pixel gray value.
                                Even images with non-uniform illumination can now be
                                processed with an <code>adaptive</code> filter which
                                takes into account the neighborhood of the current
                                pixel.

                                network input consists in moments which capture 
                                glyph key characteristics.
                                Former <code>Hu</code> geometric moments have been 
                                replaced by <code>ART</code> moments 
                                (Angular Radial Transform, as used by MPEG-7) 
                                which are less sensible to noise.

                                "piped" to external softwares such as score editors
                                or MIDI sequencers, through a flexible plugin 
                                mechanism.
                                Consequently, these features have been removed from
                                Audiveris application.

                                been tested (<code>PDFRenderer</code> for a long 
                                time, then <code>JPedal</code> and 
                                <code>PDFBox</code>) but none was really 
                                satisfactory. 
                                Hence support for PDF input is now delegated to a

                                functional and perennial solution.

                        The main improvement in Audiveris processing stems from  
                        the use of filaments organized in a kind of grid. 
                        This grid serves as a referential for the following tasks,
                        and provides an elegant approach for skewed or distorted 
                        images.

                    <div class="desc">
                        Several installation files have been published, all using 
                        the 4.1beta core name.
                        This reflects the status of continuous development rather
                        than stable release of the software.

                                <b>Filaments:</b> They are long glyphs representing 
                                the core of either horizontal or vertical lines
                                (staff lines candidates and barlines candidates
                                respectively).
                                These filaments are formalized in natural splines,
                                which are sequences of Bézier curves with continuity
                                up to the second derivative.

                                <b>Grid:</b> The staff lines and barlines are 
                                connected into a grid of sometimes rather wavy lines. 
                                The grid itself is taken as the referential 
                                for all the other glyphs, whatever the potential
                                skew or other distortion of the image, and thus
                                saving the need for any pre-processing.
                                Moreover, one can on demand easily build and save a
                                "dewarped" version of the initial image.

                                <b>Scale:</b> Additional key informations are 
                                derived from run length histograms (jitter on staff
                                line thickness and spacing, typical beam height, 
                                whether the image is music or not, ...).

                                <b>Systems:</b> The boundary between two consecutive
                                systems is now a broken line, resulting from the 
                                incremental inclusion of glyphs into their nearest 
                                system.

                                training samples, the user can select a mode that
                                takes every manual assignment as a new training 
                                sample.

                                to an aggressive strategy in glyph split pattern.

                                The new Tesseract generation (3.x) has
                                been out for more than one year now but still lacks

                                which makes them independent of the score divisions

                        The most prominent feature is the redesign of Audiveris
                        display which combines sheet and score elements into a 
                        single view. This improves clarity and saves real estate.

                                been simplified. 
                                Only two views are now shown for each sheet: 
                                <code>Picture</code> (focused on input image) and
                                <code>Data</code> (focused on items detected). 
                                We no longer have separate windows for sheet and 
                                score.
                                The score elements are displayed in a translucid 
                                manner on top of the sheet glyphs they represent, 
                                in order to visually catch any discrepency. 
                                Separate voices can be displayed each in a specific
                                color.

                                <code>Errors</code>, <code>Boards</code>) can be
                                displayed or hidden, and each individual board
                                can be selected at will.<br/>

                                (<code>Stoccata.ttf</code> then 
                                <code>MusicalSymbols.ttf</code>).
                                This allows endless zooming of displays and 
                                printouts with no loss of quality.

                                The font is even used to build artificial symbols
                                used for initial training of the neural network.

                                various glyph patterns to handle specific cases
                                (slurs, beams hooks, sharps, naturals, broken
                                clefs, imposed time signatures, etc). Thus the
                                PATTERNS step replaces the former CLEANUP step.

                                related to current Sheet or current Score. The
                                initial version of score Player was implemented
                                like this. Since then, all existing actions
                                have been retrofitted to benefit from the
                                decoupling brought by this plugin mechanism.

                                MIDI Player is provided. It enables to playback
                                the whole score, or a range of measure, or just
                                one selected measure using default or
                                customized parameters. The user can enter MIDI
                                parameters to the score, such as tempo,
                                velocity and instruments. Interface with
                                Xenoage player has been enhanced to allow
                                callback from the player in order to move the
                                score view in sync.

                                JiBX. JiBX is reported more performant,
                                especially at startup, since the binding is
                                pre-compiled directly in the class byte code.
                                Moreover, JiBX is the XML mapper used by
                                MusicXMLrep which we'll use to handle the
                                mapping to MusicXML format. So instead of the
                                Castor environment, the JiBX one must now be
                                installed (see the <a href="installation.html#OTHER_COMPONENTS">Installation

                                and STRUCTURE shapes, and the focus on a single
                                evaluator. Unless a major bug needs to be fixed,
                                this release should conclude the 2.x series focused
                                on symbol extraction.

                                evaluator can differentiate between a valid

                                globally. This eases the user actions when

                                should be avoided.

                                for improvement. Publishing the software, with
                                source code and a minimal documentation, was
                                necessary to let other potential developers
                                contribute to this project.
