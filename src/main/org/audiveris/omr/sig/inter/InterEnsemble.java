/**
 * Interface <code>InterEnsemble</code> refers to an inter that is composed of other inters,
 * with the ability to add or remove members.
 * <p>
 * Examples are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sentence vs words (and LyricLine vs LyricItems)</li>
 * <li>TimePairInter vs num and den</li>
 * <li>KeyInter vs its alterations</li>
 * <li>BeamGroupInter vs its beams</li>
 * <li>ChordInter vs its notes</li>
 * <li>FermataInter vs its arc and dot</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Such ensembles cannot durably exist and be fully defined without their members: for example, a
 * {@link SentenceInter} instance cannot exist without at least one member {@link WordInter}
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * Hence, care must be taken to avoid such "empty ensembles":
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sentence creation must be followed by inclusion of a word.
 * <li>Deletion of sole word of a sentence must be followed by sentence deletion.
 * </ul>
