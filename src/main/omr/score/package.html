            The score package, with its subpackages such as omr.score.entity,
            handles the logical music information inferred from recognized
            glyphs extracted from the physical sheet.
            The representation of such score can be stored on an external 
            support using MusicXML format.

            This is a (somewhat obsolete picture of the) hierarchy of classes :
            Score, Page, System, Slur, Stave, Measure, etc... <img src=
